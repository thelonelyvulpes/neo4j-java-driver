/**
 * A marker annotation indicating that the annotated target belongs to a preview feature.
 * <p>
 * The preview feature is a new feature that is a candidate for a future GA status. It enables users to try the feature
 * out and maintainers to refine and update it.
 * <p>
 * The preview features are not considered to be experimental, temporary or unstable. However, they may change more
 * rapidly without the deprecation cycle. Most preview features are expected to be granted the GA status unless some
 * unexpected conditions arise.
 * <p>
 * Due to the increased flexibility of the preview status, user feedback is encouraged so that it can be considered
 * before the GA status. See the driver's README for details on how to provide the feedback.
